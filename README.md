# Unsupervised-Learning-Analysis---Mobile-App-Research-Survey

Analyzed app download behavior as well as other information related to customers using unsupervised machine learning techniques to provide to the marketing department a customer segmentation.

Abstract of the analysis:

Knowing how to target consumers can be challenging. To allocate budget and resources as efficiently as possible it is important to analyze their features. The mobile app research survey enabled us to gain insights by analyzing the consumers behavior, personality traits and demographics. We were able to identify six consumer clusters with distinct features that can be targeted by the marketing department. The main differentiating characteristics can be summarized by whether they follow trends or not, whether they have a lot of apps on their phone and whether they are early adopters or followers when it comes to technological developments.
